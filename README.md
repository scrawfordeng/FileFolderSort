# FileFolderSort
The FileFolderSort is an application intended to assist in sorting large folders by dates/events. Inspiration came from dumping entire folders of family photos from an SD card that contained many individual events over a year and needed to be sorted into folders and labeled with the event name.

As a user, I would like the ability to select a folder to sort via file dialog, so that I may easily identify the folder to sort.

As a user, I would like the application to create individual folders for every day that there is a file type, so that the files for that date can be copied into that folder.

As a user, I would like a preview of one of the files per each day folder to be presented with an input dialog, so that I may label the event folder based on what I see in the preview file.

As a developer, I would like the file copies to leave the existing folder intact, so that I can be protected against accidentally deleting an important file if the copy was unsuccesful.

As a developer, I would like to modify the file properties of the copied files, so that I may later identify which files were already copied or not (future functionality? Pause/resume functions).
